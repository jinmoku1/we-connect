# Description
The goal of our project is to build a website where students and faculty members can share their interests through a simple networking service. 
Students and faculty members can form an academic network through which they can find each otherâ€™s profiles, research needs or interests, and university events. 
The website will expose students to school events and research opportunities in which they are qualified to participate and enable professors to better advertise their projects. 
It also focuses on matching users with notifications that might intrigue them.
